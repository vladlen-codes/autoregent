# Autoregent — Technical Documentation

Companion to [README.md](README.md) (quick start, live links) and [PRD.md](PRD.md) / [TRD.md](TRD.md) (product rationale). This document is the detailed technical reference: every module, every endpoint, every configuration value, and exactly how a request moves through the system.

---

## 1. Architecture overview

Autoregent is a reverse-proxy gateway. A caller sends a request to `/proxy/{path}`; the gateway dispatches it to a configured upstream, and if that upstream fails or drifts from its expected schema, the gateway decides — through a fixed, auditable pipeline — whether to repair the response or fail loudly.

Every terminal state — clean pass, healed, failed loud, loop suppressed, or budget exhausted — is either invisible (clean pass) or produces a structured, HMAC-signed `HealEvent` that the dashboard renders.

## 3. The heal pipeline, stage by stage

### 3.1 Route classification (`route_classifier.py`)

A static list of glob patterns (`*txn/*`, `*transfer*`, `*charge*`, `*payment*`, `*ledger*`) checked against the proxied path. First match wins; anything unmatched is `INFORMATIONAL`. This runs once at ingress and never changes for the life of the request.

### 3.2 Circuit pre-check (`circuit.py`, `proxy.py`)

Before any dispatch, the gateway checks the circuit for the caller-facing route (not the fallback target — the circuit is keyed by what the caller asked for). If `OPEN` and the cooldown hasn't elapsed, the request fails fast with `503` and no upstream call is made at all. If the cooldown has elapsed, the circuit moves to `HALF_OPEN` and this request becomes the probe.

### 3.3 Upstream dispatch (`dispatch.py`)

A single `httpx.AsyncClient` call with a configurable timeout. Three outcomes: a genuine transport failure (connection error, timeout) synthesizes a `504`/`502`; a normal HTTP response passes through as-is for further inspection.

### 3.4 Transactional short-circuit (`heal_pipeline.py::handle_transactional_failure`)

If the route is `TRANSACTIONAL` and the dispatch failed, the entire heal pipeline is skipped — no loop detector, no budget check, no diagnosis. The circuit trips unconditionally (one strike), the original error is propagated unchanged, and the caller's `Idempotency-Key` header (if present) is echoed back so a retry is safe. This is enforced in code, not by a prompt — Gemini's diagnosis function is never called for these routes.

### 3.5 Loop detection (`transaction_context.py::push`)

If the upstream's failure body contains a `fallback_target` key (the `cascading` mock scenario is the only demo route that sets this), the gateway checks whether that target is already in the transaction's `call_stack`. If so, the loop is suppressed immediately — the transaction is cycling back onto something it already tried, so retrying would spin forever.

### 3.6 Budget check (`circuit.py`, `heal_pipeline.py`)

Two independent limits, both enforced: `max_heals_per_transaction` (default 2) bounds a single request's fallback chain, and a rolling window (default 5 heals per 60 seconds, per route) bounds sustained load on one route. Either limit reached trips the circuit hard for that route.

### 3.7 Gemini diagnosis (`gemini_diagnosis.py`)

Called only for informational routes, only after loop/budget checks pass, and only when the failure is a schema-drift-on-200 (not a transport failure — there's no payload shape to diagnose from a raw 5xx). The request carries the failed payload, the expected JSON Schema, and the specific Pydantic validation error diff. The response uses the API's strict structured-output mode.

**Wire-format note:** the public `DriftDiagnosis.field_mapping` type is `dict[str, str]`, but the Gemini Developer API's structured-output mode rejects any schema containing `additionalProperties` (which is what Pydantic generates for an open-ended dict). The actual API call therefore requests a list of `{expected_field, source_field}` pairs and converts it to the dict shape internally — see `_GeminiDriftResponse` in `gemini_diagnosis.py`.

**Four fail-loud guards**, all enforced in code after the response comes back:
1. The call times out (`GEMINI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, default 3s) → `None`, fail loud.
2. The API call errors or returns something that fails its own schema validation → `None`, fail loud.
3. `confidence < GEMINI_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (default 0.85) → fail loud.
4. `drift_type == "unrecoverable"` or `recommendation != "heal"` → fail loud.

### 3.8 Heal executor (`heal_executor.py::apply_field_mapping`)

Pure transformation: for each key in `field_mapping`, the expected field's value is pulled from the named source key in the original payload. No value is generated, defaulted, or invented. If any mapped source key is absent from the original payload, the function returns `None` and the heal fails.

### 3.9 Validation gate (`heal_executor.py::validate_healed_payload`)

The remapped payload is validated against the expected schema via `model_validate_json(..., strict=True)` — strict JSON mode specifically, not lax Python-dict validation, because lax mode silently coerces a stringified number back into the correct type, which would swallow exactly the class of drift this gate exists to catch. This step has no AI involvement by design; it is the last, deterministic check before anything reaches the caller.

### 3.10 Telemetry inversion (`heal_pipeline.py`, `signing.py`)

On a successful heal, the caller receives `200` and five headers: `X-Autoregent-Healed`, `X-Autoregent-Trace-Id`, `X-Autoregent-Drift-Type`, `X-Autoregent-Confidence`, `X-Autoregent-Signature`. Simultaneously, a `HealEvent` is constructed, HMAC-signed (`signing.py`), appended to the in-memory `EventStore`, and logged as a `divergence_alert` — a distinct, greppable log line from the plain per-request access log.

## 4. Data model reference

### `HealEvent` (`events.py`)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `trace_id` | `str` | UUID, one per transaction |
| `timestamp` | `datetime` | UTC |
| `route` | `str` | The caller-facing path |
| `route_class` | `"TRANSACTIONAL" \| "INFORMATIONAL"` | |
| `outcome` | `"healed" \| "failed_loud" \| "loop_suppressed" \| "budget_exhausted"` | |
| `failure_reason` | `FailureReason \| None` | Disambiguates `outcome` — see below. `None` only for `healed`. |
| `is_transport_failure` | `bool` | `True` if the upstream itself errored; `False` if it returned 200 with a body that failed schema validation |
| `original_payload` / `healed_payload` | `dict \| list \| None` | Both retained — this pairing is the audit artifact |
| `diagnosis` | `DriftDiagnosis \| None` | Gemini's full structured output, when it ran |
| `call_stack` | `list[str]` | Every dispatch target this transaction touched |
| `heal_count` | `int` | Heal attempts consumed by this transaction |
| `signature` | `str \| None` | HMAC-SHA256 over the record, minus this field |

### `FailureReason` values

`circuit_open_precheck` · `transactional_short_circuit` · `loop_detected` · `budget_exhausted_transaction` · `budget_exhausted_window` · `transport_failure_no_diagnosis` · `gemini_unavailable` · `gemini_declined` · `heal_executor_missing_source` · `validation_gate_blocked` · `no_expected_schema`

This field exists because `outcome: "failed_loud"` alone is ambiguous — it's the terminal state for at least six structurally different reasons, and the dashboard's per-event pipeline diagram is built directly from this value (see `dashboard/app/lib/pipeline.ts`).

### `DriftDiagnosis` (`diagnosis.py`)

```python
class DriftDiagnosis(BaseModel):
    drift_type: Literal["field_rename", "type_change", "nesting_change", "missing_field", "unrecoverable"]
    recommendation: Literal["heal", "fail_loud"]
    confidence: float
    field_mapping: dict[str, str]
    reasoning: str
```

## 5. Configuration reference (`app/config.py`)

All values are environment variables (or `.env`), loaded via `pydantic-settings`.

| `GEMINI_MODEL` | `gemini-flash-lite-latest` | See § 7 for why this model specifically |
| `GEMINI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `3.0` | Hard timeout on the diagnosis call |
| `GEMINI_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | `0.85` | Minimum confidence to authorize a heal |

## 6. API reference

### `GET /health`
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "autoregent-gateway",
  "circuits": { "<route>": { "state": "CLOSED|OPEN|HALF_OPEN", "heals_in_window": 0 } },
  "budget_config": { "max_heals_per_transaction": 2, "rolling_window_seconds": 60.0, "rolling_window_max_heals": 5, "circuit_cooldown_seconds": 30.0 }
}
```

### `GET /events`
Returns `list[HealEvent]` (see § 4), append-only, oldest first.

### `ANY /proxy/{path}`
The gateway itself. Response is either a transparent pass-through of the upstream's response, the original upstream error, a synthesized `502 schema_drift_unresolved`, a synthesized `503 circuit_open`, or a healed `200` with `X-Autoregent-*` headers.

### `ANY /mock/{scenario}` and `ANY /mock/txn/{scenario}`
The demo upstream. Scenarios: `healthy`, `field_rename`, `type_change`, `timeout`, `500`, `cascading`. The `txn/` variant serves identical response bodies but is mounted where the route classifier tags the path `TRANSACTIONAL` — used to demonstrate that identical drift is healed on one and never touched on the other.

## 7. Operational notes learned during build

A few non-obvious things discovered empirically, kept here so they aren't rediscovered:

- **Pydantic lax validation coerces types silently.** `model_validate()` on a plain dict will happily turn `"542.1"` into `542.1`, which would make the validation gate blind to exactly the type-drift class it exists to catch. Fixed by validating raw JSON bytes with `model_validate_json(..., strict=True)` instead of a pre-parsed dict.
- **The Gemini Developer API rejects `additionalProperties` schemas.** A `dict[str, str]` field in a Pydantic model generates that constraint; the API errors on it. Vertex AI's enterprise mode supports it, the plain AI Studio key used here does not. Worked around with a list-of-pairs wire format (§ 3.7).
- **`gemini-2.5-flash` (the originally intended model) returns 404 for new API keys** — deprecated. `gemini-flash-latest` works but was measured at 14+ seconds and returned `503 UNAVAILABLE` under test load, unusable against a 3-second budget. `gemini-flash-lite-latest` measured at ~1.4s and is what's actually configured.
- **PaaS platforms block "hairpin" self-calls.** A container calling back into its own public `*.up.railway.app` domain gets rejected at the edge on Railway (and likely similar platforms). Since the mock upstream and the proxy are the same process, `UPSTREAM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080` sidesteps this entirely.
- **CSS cascade layers can silently override Tailwind utility classes.** `create-next-app`'s default `body { color: var(--foreground) }` is unlayered plain CSS, which beats any `@layer`-wrapped Tailwind utility regardless of selector specificity — this made the dashboard fall back to a light theme for any browser without an explicit dark-mode preference, despite `bg-neutral-950 text-neutral-100` being set correctly. Fixed by removing the unused light/dark toggle entirely, since the dashboard is deliberately dark-only.

---

## 8. Known limitations (v0.1)

- **State is in-memory and single-node.** A restart clears `/events` entirely; there is no persistence layer.
- **HMAC proves integrity, not non-repudiation.** A shared secret means anyone with `HMAC_SECRET` could forge a signature. A real deployment needs asymmetric signing into WORM storage.
- **No replay protection** on the trace header or signature.
- **Circuit state is not shared across instances.** Horizontal scaling would break budget enforcement as built — each instance would track its own independent circuit state.
- **`MAX_HEALS_PER_TRANSACTION` is rarely exercised by the demo scenarios**, since only the `cascading` scenario has a fallback target, and it loop-detects before consuming meaningful budget. The rolling-window budget is the one actually demonstrated under load.
